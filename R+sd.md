R and Spatial Data
========================================================

## Spatial Data in R

In any data analysis project, spatial or otherwise, it is important to have a strong 
understanding of the dataset before progressing. This section will therefore begin with 
a description of the input data used in this section. We will see how data can 
be loaded into R and exported to other formats, before going into more detail about the 
underlying structure of spatial data in R: how it 'sees' spatial data is quite unique.

## Loading and saving data

In most situations, the starting point of spatial analysis tasks is 
loading in pre-existing datasets. These may originate from government agencies, 
remote sensing devices or 'volunteered geographical information' from GPS devices, 
online databases such as Open Street Map or geo-tagged social media (Goodchild 2007).
In any case, the diversity of geographical data formats is large. 

R is able to import a very wide range of spatial data formats thanks to its
interface with the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), which is 
enabled by loading the package `rgdal` into R. Below we will
load data from two spatial data formats: GPS eXchange (`.gpx`)
and an ESRI Shapefile (consisting of at least files 
with `.shp`, `.shx` and `.dbf` extensions).

`readOGR` is in fact cabable of loading dozens more file formats, 
so the focus is on the *method* rather than the specific formats. 
The 'take home message' is that the `readOGR` function is capable 
of loading most common spatial file formats, but behaves differently depending on file type.
Let's start with a `.gpx` file, a tracklog recording a bicycle ride from Sheffield
to Wakefield which was uploaded Open Street Map. [!!! more detail?]


```r
download.file("http://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/1619756/data", destfile = "data/gps-trace.gpx")
library(rgdal)  # load the gdal package

There is a lot going on in the preceding 7 lines of code, including functions that 
you are unlikely to have encountered before. Let us think about what has happened, line-by-line.

First, we used R to *download* a file from the internet, using the function `download.file`.
The two essential arguments of this function are `url` (we could have typed`url =` before the link) 
and `destfile` (which means destination file). As with any function, more optional arguments 
can be viewed by typing `?download.file`. 

When `rgdal` has succesfully loaded, the next task is not to import the file directly, 
but to find out which *layers* are available to import, with the function `ogrListLayers`.
The output from this command tells us that various layers are available, including
`tracks` and `track_points`, which we subsequently load using `readOGR`.
The basic `plot` function is used to plot the newly imported objects, ensuring they make sense.
In the second `plot` function, we take a subset of the object (see section ... for more on this).

As stated in the help documentation (accessed by entering `?readOGR`), the `dsn =` argument 
is interpreted differently depending on the type of file used. 
In the above example, the filename was the data source name. 
To load Shapefiles, by contrast, the *folder* containing the data is used:


```r
lnd <- readOGR(dsn = "data/", "london_sport")
```


Here, the data is assumed to reside in a folder entitled `data` which in R's current 
working directory (remember to check this using `getwd()`). 
If the files were stored in the working 
directory, one would use `dsn = "."` instead. Again, it may be wise to plot the data that 
results, to ensure that it has worked correctly.
Now that the data has been loaded into R's own `sp` format, try interogating and 
plotting it, using functions such as `summary` and `plot`.

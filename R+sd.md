R and Spatial Data
========================================================

## Spatial Data in R

In any data analysis project, spatial or otherwise, it is important to have a strong 
understanding of the dataset before progressing. This section will therefore begin with 
a description of the input data used in this section. We will see how data can 
be loaded into R and exported to other formats, before going into more detail about the 
underlying structure of spatial data in R: how it 'sees' spatial data is quite particular.
